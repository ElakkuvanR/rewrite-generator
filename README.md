# rewrite-generator

This is a windows forms application created to easy the process of generating the redirects. 

Sometimes there are situation when we need to generate thousands of rewrites to add into the rewrite.config file. Creating them manually would be time consuming and a tedious process.

This application will easy the job. This will read the excel file which contains the redirect entries and process them. And it gives back the redirect results which we can easily add into the rewriterules.config file  of the web app.
